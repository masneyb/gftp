This is a list of some of the things I plan to work on for future releases
of gFTP. If there is something you feel should be included in a future
version of gFTP, please email me about it.

* For bookmarks, be able to specify a local protocol, host, port, directory
  to connect to
* SSH login sequence could be improved
* Show status information in title bar
* -d command line, check if it's a file first, if so download. If not, grab directory
* Add option for @dynamic@ for bookmarks' account
* Playing sounds after certain events or calling external program
* Ratio support
* Recursive directory compares
* Make it be able to download a directory as directory.tar
* Make it execute a program on a url (say rpm -qpi ftp://site.com/file.rpm)
* Full Gnome compatibility.
* Add registered file extensions to options dialog
* VMS directory listings
