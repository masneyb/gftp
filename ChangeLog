	issues: i) The first was a problem parsing the remote_charsets option.
	ii) The second was the same IConv structure being used for the local
	and remote side. Each side now has their own IConv structure.
	(from Alexander Orlov <alxorlov@pochta.ru>)

	field to the gftp_request structure. If this is set in
	gftpui_common_cmd_open(), then the refresh command is not ran after
	a connection is made to the server. This field is currently only
	enabled when running called from the refresh function in the GTK+
	port. It fixes an issue where the refresh command was being ran
	twice. (closes #171732)

	_gftpui_cb_connect() and _gftpui_cb_disconnect()

	* src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c (stop_button) - set the cancel variable inside
	the gftp_request structure when the stop button is pressed.

	EINTR/EGAIN, only stop trying to connect if the current operation
	was to be cancelled.

	* lib/protocols.c (_do_sleep) - don't check for EINTR/EAGAIN. Allow
	a signal to interrupt the timer.

	will automatically connect to the remote server when it is started.
	(closes #330418)

	* lib/gftp.h src/uicommon/gftpui.c - when a file transfer is restarted,
	get the file size of the destination file. This is so that the file is 
	restarted at the proper position (closes #160239). 
	(_gftpui_common_do_transfer_file) - split this function into a smaller
	function: _do_transfer_block().

	* docs/gftp-faq.sgml - added FAQ entry on how to transfer HTML files in
	binary mode using the FTP protocol.

	* docs/website/screenshots.html - updated this webpage

	* lib/gftp.h lib/protocols.c lib/local.c - added support for detecting
	recursive symbolic links. This currently only works when uploading

	this information from the SSH and FSP protocols. (closes #172499)

	* lib/local.c lib/misc.c - moved uint_hash_compare() and
	uint_hash_function() from local.c to misc.c

	* lib/sshv2.c (sshv2_initialize_string_with_path) - make sure the endpos
	variable is pointing to the position after the string. This fixes an
	issue with the current CVS code where files could not be transferred.
	(closes #371615)

2006-11-2 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/ftpcommon.h lib/ftps.c lib/rfc959.c - use the encoded filename
	length to determine how many bytes should be sent in the command to the
	remote server. Don't use the strlen() function since there may be a
	NUL character in the filename.

	ATTENTION INTERNATIONAL USERS: If you have time, can you test the
	filename encoding in CVS? All of the necessary changes were made to the
	local, FTP and SSH protocols. Let me know if you see any problems.

	* src/text/gftp-text.c src/text/gftp-text.h src/text/textui.c -

	the common code that was in gftp_string_to_utf8() and
	gftp_string_from_utf8().

	UTF8. This will be handled by the library. Removed utf8_file member from
	the gftp_file structure.

	* lib/rfc959.c - convert the file or directory from UTF8 to the proper
	locale when sending a command to the server.

	* src/uicommon/gftpui.c src/gtk/menu-items.c lib/misc.c lib/gftp.h
	(gftp_gen_ls_string) - convert the filename from UTF8 to the proper

	the server if a timeout occurs.

	* src/uicommon/gftpui.c (_gftpui_common_thread_callback) - removed
	checks for the timeouts. This is now transparently handled in the
	FTP[S]* protocols. I need to check for timeouts in the other protocols.

	* src/gtk/transfer.c src/uicommon/gftpui.c src/uicommon/gftpui.h - added
	new functions for canceling and skipping file transfers

2006-9-26 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/rfc959.c (rfc959_end_transfer) - close the data connection before
	the control connection is closed. (rfc959_put_next_file_chunk) - make
	sure the entire block is properly written to the server. This is due to
	the ASCII conversion (if necessary) is performed in this function. 
	Removed rfc959_set_file_time().

	unneeded code that checks for a block size of 0

	* lib/rfc959.c (rfc959_syst) - disable show_hidden_files and
	resolve_remote_symlinks if the remote system type is OS/400.

2006-8-10 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/options.h src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c (_gftp_exit) - added new option:
	remember_last_directory. This will control whether or not the last
	directory is remembered when the application is closed. I had a lot
	of people ask for this option. I personally find it annoying, which
	is why I left the option disabled by default.

	* src/gtk/gtkui.c (gftpui_refresh) - delete the cache entry before
	checking to see if it needs to reconnect to the remote server

	* src/uicommon/gftpui.c (gftpui_common_cmd_site) - make sure the

	      entries, because the sensitivity of these widgets 
	      is toggled by the host type radio buttons
	   *  Toggle the sensitivity of the labels when 
	      changing host type

	closed if a child entry is being edited. Fixes for a toplevel folder
	that has no children

	* src/gtk/transfer.c (update_file_status) - if the % transferred goes
	over 100%, then set the update string to unknown percentage transfered.
	This will occur whenever the reported transfer size is different than
	what is actually being transfered. This occurs whenever a symlink is
	being transfered

	filename that is to be displayed to the user is encoded in UTF8

2004-10-3 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/protocols.c (gftp_string_to_utf8) - if the current string is
	already in UTF-8, always return NULL, even if the iconv module is
	initialized for this session. If there is an error converting the
	non-UTF8 string to the current locale, then display a message to the
	user

	gftp_protocol_default_port() that will return the default port for
	the current protocol

	* src/gtk/misc-gtk.c (update_window_info) - when updating the toolbar
	with the connection status, if the current connection is using the
	default port for it's protocol, then leave the port field blank. This
	should help users who want to reconnect to the current site using a
	different protocol

	the Port input box

	* lib/rfc959.c lib/ftpcommon.h - added internal option to quote

	* lib/sshv2.c - added sshv2_open_file(). sshv2_get_file() and
	sshv2_put_file() now use this function

	* src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c - removed local shortcuts for Disconnect
	and Open URL. These conflicted with other items

	* lib/misc.c - when sorting by file, user or group, do a case

	GFTP_OFF_T_INTL_PRINTF_MOD, GFTP_OFF_T_PRINTF_MOD,
	GFTP_OFF_T_11PRINTF_MOD and gftp_parse_file_size). Fixed file size
	not being displayed properly when the system does not support the '
	printf formatter

	* acinclude.m4 (AC_INTL_PRINTF) - check to see if _LARGEFILE_SOURCE
	is defined. If so, use %'lld instead of %'ld

	functions

2004-8-9 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>

	function so that uploading files will work again

	* lib/options.h src/uicommon/gftpui.c - added ability to change the
	block size on the fly of the transfered files.

	* lib/config_file.c lib/options.h lib/rfc959.c - fixed warnings about

	src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c src/gtk/gftp-gtk.h src/gtk/gtkui.c 
	src/gtk/menu-items.c src/gtk/transfer.c - added
	gftp_gtk_get_list_selection() macro

2004-7-27 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/rfc959.c src/gtk/misc-gtk.c src/gtk/view_dialog.c - fixed more
	comparsions between signed and unsigned integers

	* lib/sshv2.c (sshv2_buffer_get_int32) - allow an expected response
	value of 0. If it does not match, call sshv2_wrong_response().
	SSH_FX_OK is set to 0, so this value was not being checked

	* src/gtk/gtkui.c src/text/textui.c src/uicommon/gftpui.h - renamed the
	clear_cache argument of gftpui_refresh() to clear_cache_entry. There is
	already a function named clear_cache()

	* lib/gftp.h lib/local.c lib/protocols.c lib/sshv2.c - changed
	declaration of gftp_stat_filename() so that the mode of the filename
	is returned as a parameter instead of the function return value.
	The mode_t type is unsigned and the error codes could not be reported
	properly

	* lib/sshv2.c - fixed SSHV2 transfers so that they work again
	(they were busted in the last CVS commit due to the wrong file
	offset being sent over)

	* src/gtk/misc-gtk.c - fix for the log window so that the contents
	are properly shown. (this was busted in the last CVS commit)

	* lib/protocols.c lib/rfc2068.c lib/rfc959.c lib/sshv2.c

	analysis checker. (some signed/unsigned fixes, removed unneeded casts,
	removed unneeded variables, more consistency, largefile fixes). Thanks
	to Derek M Jones for running the static code analysis for me

	* lib/cache.c - s/remove/del_entry/g

	* lib/bookmark.c lib/protocols.c (gftp_parse_bookmark) - allow
	the third parameter of this function to be a NULL pointer

	wait to reconnect if the connection to the server timed out

	* src/gtk/transfer.c - when spawning a thread to get the

	don't get established

	* src/uicommon/gftpui.c src/uicommon/gftpui.h - added dont_refresh

	it is already set to the current working directory

	* lib/protocols.c (gftp_get_all_subdirs) - if there is an error in the
	protocol function, make sure the error code is returned as is. This is
	so that timeouts can be detected properly

2004-7-19 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>

	issues for older releases section. All of the issues that this talks
	about have been fixed in CVS.

	* lib/gftp.h lib/pty.c lib/sshv2.c - added gftp_exec() that will always
	open a pseudo terminal and a separate socket pair for the stdin/stdout
	file descriptors. The banner and password request will come through the
	pseudo terminal while the sftp protocol specific data will always come
	through the socket pair. This allows for a much cleaner SSH login
	sequence that does not require echo xsftp to capture a login banner. 
	Removed option ssh_use_askpass since it is no longer needed.
	This code is based off of a suggestion from Gertjan Halkes

	* src/text/gftp-text.c - removed setting the options ssh_use_askpass
	and sshv2_use_sftp_subsys

	gftp_logging_misc_nolog

	* src/gtk/gtkui.c (gftpui_generic_thread) - fixed segfault. Pass
	cdata structure instead of wdata.

2004-1-4 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* src/text/Makefile.am src/gtk/Makefile.am - added @LIBINTL@ to LDADD
	line of Makefile.am

	* configure.in - added src/uicommon/Makefile to the list of files to
	be generated. 

	* configure.in lib/gftp.h - check for sys/mkdev.h header file. If it is
	found, include it. Solaris needs this for major() and minor()

	* src/uicommon/gftpui.c src/uicommon/gftpui.h
	src/uicommon/gftpuicallbacks.c - when switching between ascii/binary,
	set the option on a global basis. Converted chdir, chmod, delete,
	rename, rmdir commands over to using the new command run format so that
	it will work in the different UIs. Added site command to the command
	line.

	* lib/misc.c (gftp_parse_command_line) - unified this function so that
	it is consistent for all arguments.

	* lib/protocols.c (gftp_file_destroy) - fixed memory leak (utf8_file
	was not being freed)

	* docs/gftp-faq.sgml - updated link to the (old) threaded version of
	XFree86 libraries

2003-12-29 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* po/POTFILES.in - added the new uicommon files to this file

2003-12-28 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* src/gtk/gtkui.c src/text/textui.c - necessary UI related files for
	each port of gftp. The uicommon code will call these functions.

2003-12-28 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	**** NOTE: this commit breaks a lot of functionality in gftp. I ****
	**** still have more work to do on this. Please don't email me  ****
	**** saying that the CVS code is broken.                        ****

	* lib/bookmark.c lib/gftp.h lib/local.c lib/options.h lib/rfc2068.c
	lib/rfc959.c lib/sshv2.c - moved the use_threads option from the
	request structure over to the protocol declaration in options.h.

	* lib/options.h src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c - added cmd_in_gui option. When this
	option is enabled, a new toolbar will be shown in the GTK+ port that
	will allow you to control the GUI by entering manual commands.

	* src/Makefile.am - added uicommon directory

	* src/gtk/Makefile.am src/text/Makefile.am - link in the uicommon
	library.

	* src/uicommon/* src/text/gftp-text.c - moved most of the functionality
	of the text port over to the uicommon directory. Made this code a little
	more generic so that the GTK+ port can have a text interface
	associated with it.

	* src/gtk/gtkui.c src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c src/gtk/mkdir_dialog.c
	src/gtk/rename_dialog.c src/gtk/menu-items.c src/gtk/misc-gtk.c -
	started to clean up the callback functions and make them more tightly
	integrated with the uicommon code.

	* src/gtk/bookmarks.c src/gtk/chmod_dialog.c src/gtk/delete_dialog.c
	src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c src/gtk/menu-items.c src/gtk/misc-gtk.c
	src/gtk/transfer.c -
	s/refresh/gftpui_refresh/g
	s/jmp_environment/gftpui_common_jmp_environment/g
	s/request->use_threads/gftpui_common_use_threads (request)/g

	* src/gtk/options_dialog.c (apply_changes) - whenever the options are
	saved, check to see if the command entry needs to be shown or hidden.

2003-12-10 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/rfc959.c - fix IPv6 compile problem when IPv6 support is not
	available on the system.

	* lib/gftp.h src/text/gftp-text.h src/gtk/gftp-gtk.h - added
	GFTP_LOG_FUNCTION_ATTRIBUTES that is only defined when compiled
	against gcc. When this is set, it will specify the function is
	printf() type function so that extra checks can be done by the
	compiler. This is to fix problems with older Sun compilers.

	* src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c src/gtk/menu-items.c src/gtk/misc-gtk.c - check
	for a timeout from the remote server when refreshing the directory
	listing and changing directores. If it did, reconnect to the server.

	* lib/rfc2068.c - set the default file attributes to -rw-r--r-- for
	all files.

2003-12-7 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/options.h lib/config_file.c - removed scramble_passwords
	option. Instead, make this the default action all the time. This
	is to avoid having too many unnecessary options. Also put a note
	at the top of the bookmarks file stating the passwords are being
	scrambled.

	* lib/config_file.c lib/gftp.h lib/misc.c lib/options.h - added
	scramble passwords option. This patch is mostly from Aurelien Jarno
        <lists@aurel32.net>, but it was modified by me quite a bit. This is
	not safe, and can be broken. That is why it's labeled scrambled
	passwords instead of encrypt passwords.

	* acinclude.m4 - fix to AC_INTL_PRINTF

	* src/gtk/dnd.c (openurl_get_drag_data) - if we are connected to a
	remote site, disconnect before parsing the URL. This fixes a bug where
	the directory was not being refreshed properly (from Aurelien Jarno
	<lists@aurel32.net>)
	
	* configure.in acinclude.m4 lib/misc.c - added AC_INTL_PRINTF macro.
	If the printf family of functions supports %'ld, then HAVE_INTL_PRINTF
	will be defined. The appropriate version of insert_commas() can be
	used.

2003-12-4 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* src/gftp.in - check for the bin_dir for the binary location

	* lib/cache.c lib/misc.c lib/protocols.c lib/rfc2068.c lib/rfc959.c 
	lib/sshv2.c lib/sslcommon.c src/text/gftp-text.c src/gtk/chmod_dialog.c
	src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c src/gtk/menu-items.c src/gtk/misc-gtk.c
	src/gtk/mkdir_dialog.c src/gtk/rename_dialog.c src/gtk/transfer.c -
	when calling gftp_lookup_global_option() or
	gftp_lookup_request_option(), if the value is an integer, declare
	the variable type to be intptr_t. This fixes a bug on 64bit platforms
	(from Gwenole Beauchesne <gbeauchesne@mandrakesoft.com>)

	* lib/config_file.c (gftp_config_file_read_float) - 64bit fixup

	* configure.in - increment version to 2.0.17pre0. Undefine _GNU_SOURCE.
	Check for stdint.h.

	* lib/gftp.h - include stdint.h if it is found on the system.

	* src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c (CreateToolbar) - on startup, have the host edit
	box grab the keyboard focus

2003-11-30 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/sshv2.c - cleaned up some of the code. Added a temporary fix for
	an upload crash that is happening on FreeBSD. 

	* src/gtk/transfer.c - shows status information in title bar. (patch
	from Jamil Geor <jamil_geor@yahoo.co.nz>, cleaned up by me some)

	* lib/options.h - added show_trans_in_title option.
	
2003-11-25 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/misc.c (gftp_locale_init) - call bindtextdomain() so that the
	directory is setup properly

	* lib/misc.c lib/gftp.h lib/config_file.c - move copyfile() to 
	config_file.c and declare it to be static. On the destination file,
	set the flag O_EXCL

2003-11-23 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* src/gtk/transfer.c - when transfering a file, if the file being
	transfered is greater in the destination than in the source, overwrite
	it

	* lib/rfc959.c (rfc959_ipv6_data_connection_new) - when parsing the
	output, parse the integers as unsigned.

2003-11-9 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/options.h lib/protoocols.c - added enable_ipv6 option. 

	* lib/rfc959.c lib/protocols.c - if there is an error creating a socket,
	log a more informative error about what kind of socket was attempted
	to be created.

	* debian/* - updated Debian package files from 
	Aurelien Jarno <aurel32@debian.org>

2003-11-9 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* Officially released 2.0.16

	* debian/ChangeLog - incremented version to 2.0.16

	* docs/Makefile.am - clean up documentation in clean target

	* docs/website/generate-gftp-website.pl docs/website/index.html.in -
	copy README/FAQ that is automatically generated to the website.

	* docs/website/install.html docs/website/faq.html - no longer needed
	anymore.

	* docs/website/index.html.in - updated the list of languages

	* ChangeLog-old - updated with brief list of changes since 2.0.15

2003-11-7 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/gftp.h lib/local.c lib/protocols.c lib/rfc2068.c lib/rfc959.c
	lib/sshv2.c - added copy_param_options method to gftp_request
	structure. When a gftp_request structure is copied, if a
	copy_param_options method exists, this will be called so that the
	local protocol data can be copied over. This is only used by the
	FTP protocol at the moment to save the current state of Ascii or
	Binary transfers.

	* src/gtk/transfer.c (transfer_done) - when a transfer is
	completed, copy the local protocol options back to the main window

	* lib/rfc959.c (gftp_set_data_type) - check the return value of 
	rfc959_send_command() and if there is an error, return that
	error.

	* configure.in - added 'hr' to ALL_LINGUAS

2003-11-5 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* TODO - updated

	* configure.in - updated version to 2.0.16.

	* configure.in docs/Makefile.am - Added check for the db2html
	command (from gtk+ configure)

	* docs/gftp-faq.sgml - updated with more information

	* docs/website/index.html.in - updated list of translations

	* lib/misc.c (expand_path) - expand paths with double slashes
	properly to support Novell directory listings.
	(gftp_build_path) - better checking of paths that end in /.
	(gftp_info) - show if _REENTRANT was defined when it was compiled.

	* README - removed, this is automatically generated now.

2003-11-3 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* docs/gftp-faq.sgml docs/Makefile.am - added initial SGML version
	of the gFTP FAQ. I used the same format as the GTK+ FAQ.

	* lib/gftp.h src/gtk/transfer.c src/gtk/delete_dialog.c - removed
	transfer_direction variable from gftp_transfer structure. Cleaned
	up the code that did checks based on the value of this variable.

	* lib/rfc959.c (rfc959_syst) - added a check for Novell FTP servers

	* src/gtk/transfer.c (add_file_transfer) - check the value of the option
	one_transfer and if that is disabled, do not append the file transfers.
	(transfer_done) - refresh the destination window correctly after a
	transfer is completed.

2003-11-2 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/rfc2068.c (rfc2068_get_file) - if there is any data in the current
	read buffer, grab that data first. Otherwise, read from the socket.

	* lib/rfc2068.c (rfc2068_chunked_read) - more improvements to this
	function so that it will parse more chunked file transfers correctly.

	* lib/misc.c lib/gftp.h lib/rfc2068.c src/gtk/bookmarks.c 
	src/gtk/dnd.c - removed remove_double_slashes(). Call gftp_build_path()
	to build the paths. This now allows Novell directory listings with 
	//server

	* lib/protocols.c src/gtk/transfer.c lib/gftp.h - added variable
	conn_error_no_timeout to gftp_transfer structure. If this is enabled,
	if the remote connection to the server timed out, don't wait and
	immediately reconnect. So far, the only time this is used is when the
	user was editing a file and it is to be uploaded back to the server.

	* src/gtk/gftp-gtk.h src/gtk/transfer.c - add_file_transfer() now
	returns the struct gftp_transfer that was just added.

	* src/gtk/misc-gtk.c (update_directory_download_progress) - don't
	make the window a popup and remove the window decorations

	* src/text/gftp-text.c - don't populate the transfer_direction variable
	in struct gftp_transfer. This is only needed by the GTK+ port and will
	hopefully be taken out soon.

	* lib/gftp.h - remove gftp_transfer_type enum. It wasn't used anymore.
	
2003-10-27 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/rfc959.c (gftp_get_next_file_chunk) - fixed ASCII file corruption
	bug.

	* TODO - the top of this file now contains a list of items that needs
	to be completed before 2.0.16 can be released. If I missed something
	important, please drop me an email.

2003-10-26 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/rfc959.c (gftp_{get,put}_next_file_chunk) - check whether or not
	this is an ascii file transfer properly.

	* lib/rfc959.c - convert the PASS command from UTF8 using 
	gftp_convert_from_utf8()

	* src/gtk/gftp-gtk.h src/gtk/transfer.c - (create_transfer, 
	transfer_done) - added more checks whenever a transfer is created and
	stopped to make sure we don't log into the same remote host twice. This
	is mainly for DnD.

	* lib/misc.c (copy_request) - don't copy over the hostp pointer. This
	fixes a segfault in DnD

	* lib/sshv2.c - cleaned up the ssh2_params structure some

	* src/gtk/dnd.c - cleaned up the DND code some.

2003-10-25 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* src/gtk/menu-items.c (dosave_directory_listing) - when saving the
	directory listing, skip over the files that are not shown based on the
	current filespec.

	* src/gtk/transfer.c src/gtk/gftp-gtk.h src/gtk/view_dialog.c - when
	editing a remote file, if the user chooses to upload the changes, make
	sure the upload is not sent to the current directory on the remote
	server.

	* lib/rfc2068.c - set the shown attributes to be -rw------- instead of
	----------. The HTTP server doesn't send the attributes over, so I just
	have to make something up.

	* src/gtk/options_dialog.c - make sure all of the tooltips text is
	passed to gettext()

	* lib/protocols.c - if the file transfer is to be throttled, only
	display the throttle message once.

	* lib/local.c (local_get_next_file) - if the file is a symlink, grab
	file size and attributes from the file this symlink points to.

2003-10-22 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/rfc2068.c - fixed parsing some chunked file transfers

2003-10-19 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/rfc959.c - abort a file transfer properly. When a transfer is
	aborted, you will not be disconnected from the remote site.

	* lib/protocols.c lib/gftp.h - added gftp_string_from_utf8(). Also, make
	gftp_string_{to,from}_utf8() be defined all the time. When using 
	glib 1.2, the functions will always return NULL.

	* lib/protocols.c - when creating a directory or renaming files, make
	sure the new name is converted from UTF8 to the local character set
	or the charset specified in the remote_charsets option.

	* src/gtk/misc-gtk.c (update_window_info) - when showing the directory
	we are currently in, make sure it is converted to UTF8

2003-10-18 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/misc.c lib/gftp.h src/text/gftp-text.c src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c - added
	gftp_locale_init().

	* src/gtk/Makefile.am src/text/Makefile.am - removed declaration of
	LOCALE_DIR

	* lib/Makefile.am - added declaration of LOCALE_DIR

	* lib/misc.c (insert_commas) - if _GNU_SOURCE is defined, instead of
	using my builtin function for formatting numbers, use glibc's %'ld
	(or %'lld) format to print the numbers out. This is more portable for
	other locales.

2003-10-17 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/rfc959.c (rfc959_ipv[46]_data_connection_new) - when there is an
	error establishing a connection to the remote server, make sure that
	GFTP_ERETRYABLE is returned.

2003-10-13 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* src/gtk/options_dialog.c - when specifying a FTP proxy config in the 
	GTK+ 2.0 port, the last character was getting chopped off.

2003-10-12 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/rfc959.c - when logging in to the server, if a 5xx code is 
	returned, don't attempt to log in again.

	* src/gtk/bookmarks.c - disconnect from the site before we parse the
	bookmarks (from Aurelien Jarno <lists@aurel32.net>)

	* lib/sshv2.c - fixed crash when deleting subdirectories with the SSH2
	protocol.

2003-10-4 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/protocols.c - fix for CRAY directory listings. Some UNIX directory
	listings with files containing spaces could be misinterpreted.

	* cvsclean - purge the m4 directory, but save the largefile.m4 file.
	(from Nathan Robertson <nathanr@nathanr.net>)

2003-10-03  Marcel Telka  <marcel@telka.sk>

	* configure.in (ALL_LINGUAS): Added sk.

	* lib/rfc959.c - fixed rename bug (from 
	Aurelien Jarno <aurel32@debian.org>)

	* src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c - make the help menu left aligned so that it is
	more consistent with other GNOME apps 
	(from Miguel Ibarra <mibarra@ximian.com>)

	* src/gtk/transfer.c - right after the pointer to the next transfer
	is moved, set the current transfer size back to 0. The user could
	briefly (< 1 sec) see the old size transfered on the next file.
	
2003-09-23  Taneem Ahmed  <taneem@bengalinux.org>

	* configure.in: Added "bn" to ALL_LINGUAS.

2003-9-21 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* src/gtk/menu-items.c (dosave_directory_listing) - fixed a bug that 
	would occur when saving directory listings to a file, the last filename
	in the list was never written to the file 
	(from Aurelien Jarno <aurel32@debian.org>)

	* lib/protocols.c (gftp_parse_bookmark) lib/gftp.h lib/bookmark.c 
	src/gtk/bookmarks.c - added pointer to refresh_local variable that is
	enabled if the local directory was changed. In src/gtk/bookmarks.c, if
	the local directory was changed, refresh the directory listing.

	* lib/local.c src/gtk/transfer.c src/text/gftp-text.c - if there is a
	dangling symlink in the current directory, don't bail out. This was 
	causing directory listings to appear truncated.

	* configure.in - increment version to 2.0.16pre0

	* lib/rfc959.c - if there is a login failure, return GFTP_ERETRYABLE
	(from winkey <rush@winkey.oompah.org>)

2003-09-01  Metin Amiroff  <metin@karegen.com>

	* src/gtk/transfer.c (update_file_status) - fix possible division by 0

2003-8-4 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c (CreateMenus) - on startup, select the proper
	ASCII/binary radio button (looks like an old bug!)

	* lib/misc.c lib/gftp.h - renamed my version of g_build_path() (was
	used only in glib 1.2 only) to gftp_build_path() and it's compiled in
	all the time now

	* lib/protocols.c lib/sshv2.c src/gtk/dnd.c src/gtk/menu-items.c - 
	instead of using g_build_path(), use gftp_build_path()

2003-8-3 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/local.c (local_put_file) - specify an initial file creation mode
	of 0644

	* lib/sshv2.c - fix blocking problem reading the error message from the
	remote server when there was an error establishing a connection

	* lib/misc.c (copy_fdata) - copy utf8_file variable in gftp_file
	structure. (fix double free that was only in development version)

	* lib/misc.c - added --info argument to the command line. This will 
	call gftp_info(), which will print out some information about how
	gftp was compiled. 

	* lib/protocols.c lib/bookmarks.c lib/gftp.h src/gtk/bookmarks.c -
	added local_request parameter to gftp_parse_bookmark(). If this is not

	system

	* lib/sshv2.c - don't print out the network error as well when getting
	the error message from the remote server. The user is only interested
	in the error returned from the server.
	
2003-7-22 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/config_file.c lib/gftp.h - added gftp_lookup_bookmark_option()
	and gftp_set_bookmark_option(). Also added _gftp_set_option_value()
	that is used by the set functions for bookmark and request structures

	* src/gtk/bookmarks.c - make sure the options are copied over to the
	new bookmarks. Also show all of the editable toptions for this bookmark
	entry

	* src/gtk/options_dialog.c src/gtk/gftp-gtk.h lib/config_file.c 
	lib/gftp.h - improvements to overriding options for each bookmark 
	entry. There is still one crash that is occuring that I have to track
	down. For the moment, don't edit the bookmarks twice in the same 
	session.

2003-7-20 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/config_file.c lib/gftp.h - added compare_function to 
	gftp_config_vars structure. (gftp_set_global_option) use the compare
	function to see if the value was actually changed, and if so set the
	gftp_configuration_changed variable

	* lib/misc.c lib/gftp.h - For glib 1.2, added my version of 
	g_build_path() since it's not there

	* lib/misc.c - GLIB/GTK+ 1.2 fixes

	* lib/protocols.c (gftp_fd_open) - cleaned up some

	* lib/rfc959.c (rfc959_init) - if the email address is blank, get the
	users address here instead of in register_module. It was being blanked 
	out when the config file was being read

	config variables that can show up in the bookmarks editor

	* src/text/gftp-text.c src/gtk/options_dialog.c - use 
	gftp_set_global_option() to set the new configuration values

	* src/gtk/bookmarks.c - fixed crash in bookmarks dialog. Added notebook
	widget to the dialog as well. The options that can be edited for this 
	site will show up in other tabs

2003-7-11 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/protocols.c (gftp_calc_kbs) - only call gettimeofday() at the
	end only if we are throttling this connection

	option to determine the amount of time that cache entries will stay 
	around

	* docs/gftp.xml docs/legal.xml docs/figures/* - documentation from
	Alexander Kirillov <kirillov@math.sunysb.edu>

	* docs/website - files for generating my main website. They aren't
	pretty, but hey it works. I'm mainly putting these in CVS just for
	backup purposes.

2003-7-10 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/misc.c (insert_commas) - improved calculating # of digits
	in number. (Not sure if this worked properly for long long's, aka
	off_t when _LARGEFILE_SOURCE is defined)

	* src/gtk/transfer.c (update_file_status) - changed type of remaining
	field to be off_t. (hopefully fixes >2.1GB problem)

	* lib/protocols.c (gftp_calc_kbs) - improved throttling module.

2003-7-9 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/sshv2.c - if we are logging in to the server, and the message 
	size is too big from the server, assume that an error message follows
	and log the ASCII text to the log window

	* src/gtk/options_dialog.c - make sure the value is set properly for
	the textcomboedt option types (the FTP proxy server type uses this)

	* lib/rfc2068.c - HTTP proxy bug fixes. Also, moved rfc2068_connect()
	call to rfc2068_send_command() and removed it from the now unneeded
	places. Also, fix in call to HEAD command

	* src/text/gftp-text.c - fixed NULL pointer deference in changing 
	directory

	* docs/sample.gftp/gftprc - enable require SSH user/pass by default

2003-7-9 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/config_file.c (gftp_write_config_file) - fix for writing out
	list items to the config file. 

	* lib/config_file.c lib/gftp.h - added gftp_free_proxy_hosts() and
	gftp_copy_proxy_hosts()

	* lib/protocols.c (gftp_connect_server) - look up dont_use_proxy
	instead of ext

	* lib/protocols.c lib/sshv2.c src/gtk/dnd.c src/gtk/menu-items.c - 
	when calling g_build_path(), set the directory separator to / instead
	of G_DIR_SEPARATOR_S

	* src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c (toolbar_hostedit) - fixed crash

	* src/gtk/gftp-gtk.h - removed gotbytes from gftp_window_data
	structure

	* src/gtk/options_dialog.c - show proxy hosts in options dialog

	* docs/sample.gftp/gftprc - new default config file

2003-7-7 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* configure.in src/gtk/Makefile.am src/text/Makefile.am - if the 
	OpenSSL libraries are available on the system, link them in and
	define USE_SSL. The generic SSL engine and the HTTPS protocol checks
	for this

	* lib/protocols.c (gftp_get_line) - small fix

	* lib/rfc2068.c - fixed several bugs in the handling of chunked 
	messages that are spread across multiple packets (the HTTPS protocol
	unconvered all of these)

	* lib/sslcommon.c - several fixes and cleanups

2003-7-6 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/configure.in - check for getdtablesize()

	* TODO - updated

2003-7-6 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/protocols.c lib/sshv2.c src/gtk/dnd.c src/gtk/menu-items.c -
	instead of using g_strconcat to build the directory paths, use
	g_build_path. Fixes a bug when you was connected to a remote host,
	and you was in /, the path would show up as // 
	(from Krzysztof Foltman <kfoltman@onet.pl>, slightly changed by me)

2003-7-6 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/pty.c lib/gftp.h - added gftp_exec_with_new_pty() and
	gftp_exec_without_new_pty()

	* lib/sshv2.c - use the 2 new functions above

	* lib/pty.c lib/gftp.h - split open_ptys() to _gftp_ptym_open()
	and _gftp_ptys_open()

	* lib/sslcommon.c - don't do thread setup if we are compiling against
	glib 1.2. I do not want to link against the pthread library because 
	that would make the text port dependant on pthreads being installed on
	the box

2003-7-5 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/protocols.c (gftp_get_line) - fixed bug where the read function
	was being called one extra time after the end of file was reached

	* lib/rfc2068.c - fixes for chunked file transfers. All known issues with the
	HTTP protocol should be (hopefully) fixed now

	* lib/httpcommon.h (struct rfc2068_params_tag) - added eof variable

2003-7-1 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/misc.c (base64_encode) - alphabet fix (+ wasn't a valid
	character, it should have been /) (thanks to Holger Kiehl
	<Holger.Kiehl@dwd.de> for pointing this out)

	* lib/config_file.c lib/gftp.h - added copy function for options
	variables. The functions gftp_config_file_copy_text(), 
	gftp_config_file_copy_ptr_contents() and gftp_config_file_copy_color()
	were added

	* lib/protocols.c - make sure the remote_charsets string is restored
	properly after it is used

	* src/gtk/bookmarks.c - remove memory leak comments, these are fixed
	now

	* src/gtk/transfer.c - removed start_file_transfers variable

	* src/gtk/misc-gtk.c src/gtk/gftp-gtk.h lib/misc.c lib/gftp.h - moved
	get_next_selection() to lib

	* acinclude.h (AC_TYPE_SOCKLEN_T) - AC_DEFINE fix (from
	Nathan Robertson <nathanr@nathanr.net>)

2003-6-25 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/misc.c (expand_path) - small improvements

	* lib/rfc2068.c src/text/gftp-gtk.c - fixes for path handling, namely
	when changing directories to the parent (..)

2003-6-25 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/misc.c - fix warning if DMALLOC is disabled

	* src/text/gftp-text.c - don't attempt to expand the local directory

	* TODO - updated

2003-6-25 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* acinclude.m4 - added AC_TYPE_SOCKLEN_T. Thanks to
	Nathan Robertson <nathanr@nathanr.net> for pointing this out

	* configure.in - call AC_TYPE_SOCKLEN_T. Updates to AC_OUTPUT

	* lib/gftp.h - remove check for HAVE_SOCKLEN_T
	
	* Makefile.am - formatting fixes

2003-6-25 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* configure.in - added mk to ALL_LINGUAS

	* lib/gftp.h - added several macros for dmalloc

	* lib/misc.c src/text/gftp-text.c src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c - added
	gftp_shutdown() to misc.c. This will write out the configuration
	file, clear the cache, and if dmalloc is enabled, free the memory
	that was allocated on startup

	* lib/config_file.c lib/gftp.h lib/misc.c lib/options.h - added
	gftp_configuration_changed parameter

	* lib/config_file.c lib/misc.c lib/protocols.c - added 
	gftp_config_free_options()

	* lib/config_file.c src/gtk/bookmarks.c - added gftp_bookmarks() which
	is derived mostly from bm_close_dialog()

	* lib/rfc959.c - added rfc959_request_destroy(). Free the getline
	buffers in this function

	* src/gtk/misc-gtk.c (gftp_item_factory_translate) - remove double 
	g_strdup() call

	* lib/config_file.c lib/gftp.h src/gtk/misc-gtk.c - moved
	get_xpm_path() to GTK+ port. No longer call it startup when reading
	the config file
	
2003-6-24 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/config_file.c lib/gftp.h lib/protocols.c - added backend for 
	overriding options on a per bookmark basis. Also added 
	gftp_copy_local_options() to config_file.c

	* lib/gftp.h lib/misc.c src/gtk/bookmarks.c - added
	gftp_free_bookmark() to misc.c. It was taken from the function
	free_bookmark_entry_items() in bookmarks.c

	* lib/sslcommon.c - formatting fixes. Added thread functions (mostly 
	from the OReilly SSL book)

2003-6-22 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/config_file.c lib/gftp.h - renamed parse_args to 
	gftp_config_parse_args() and removed the static declaration

	* lib/protocols.c (gftp_request_destroy) - fixed memory problem with 
	the new local configuration interface

	* src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c - added gftp_gtk_config_(read|write)_color().
	I am overriding the read and write functions for
	gftp_option_type_color to be these functions. This is so that I can
	use a GdkColor structure instead of a gftp_color structure

	* src/gtk/misc-gtk.c - when destroying the dialogs, set the pointers
	to NULL before we call the callback functions. This is to make sure
	that they aren't being used in the callbacks

	* TODO - updated

2003-6-19 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* autogen.sh - updated to hopefully make it more portable across
	various systems

	* lib/rfc959.c - change variable type of data_addr_len from size_t
	to socklen_t (fixed warnings on 64 bit machines)

	* src/gtk/chmod_dialog.c src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c src/gtk/menu-items.c
	src/gtk/misc-gtk.c src/gtk/mkdir_dialog.c src/gtk/options_dialog.c
	src/gtk/rename_dialog.c src/gtk/transfer.c - rather than casting
	from integer to pointer and vice versa, use GINT_TO_POINTER and
	GPOINTER_TO_INT. These macros do the exact same thing and I'm 
	still getting compiler warnings on Debian Sparc64 with -m64, but at
	least I'll be able to fix the define in glib and then these warnings
	will be fixed then

2003-6-18 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/protocols.c - send right parameters to the logging function
	(from Nam SungHyun <namsh@kldp.org>)

2003-6-17 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* src/gtk/misc-gtk.c (ftp_log) - remote charset fixes for when the log 
	message is generated inside a child thread

	* lib/cache.c - don't complain about not being able to open index.db

2003-6-16 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/protocols.c (gftp_string_to_utf8) - return if request is NULL

	* lib/protocols.c - run g_iconv_close() in gftp_disconnect() instead
	of gftp_end_transfer()

	* lib/gftp.h src/text/gftp-text.c src/gtk/misc-gtk.c - changed 2nd
	parameter of logging function to be a request structure, instead of
	request->user_data. In the logging functions, if the string isn't in
	UTF-8, convert it with gftp_string_to_utf8()

	* lib/bookmark.c lib/cache.c lib/gftp.h lib/https.c lib/local.c
	lib/protocols.c lib/rfc2068.c lib/rfc959.c lib/sshv2.c lib/sslcommon.c
	src/gtk/chmod_dialog.c src/gtk/delete_dialog.c src/gtk/gftp-gtk.h 
	src/gtk/menu-items.c src/gtk/misc-gtk.c src/gtk/mkdir_dialog.c 
	src/gtk/rename_dialog.c src/gtk/transfer.c src/text/gftp-text.c 
	src/gtk/gftp-gtk.h src/text/gftp-text.h - pass request structure
	to logging function instead of request->user_data

	* lib/protocols.c (_gftp_get_next_charset) - set the separator for
	remote charsets to be a comma

	* lib/options.h - updated description of remote charsets

	* lib/gftp.h lib/misc.c lib/options.h lib/protocols.c
	src/gtk/misc-gtk.c - added remote_charsets option. Whenever a file is
	read in that is not in UTF-8, it will first attempt to convert it from
	the local charset, and if that fails, it will try each of the locales
	in this list. I have no idea if this even works, so if someone can test
	this, please let me know.

2003-6-15 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/cache.c lib/gftp.h - added gftp_generate_cache_description(). 

	* lib/cache.c lib/gftp.h src/text/gftp-text.c src/gtk/delete-dialog.c 
	src/gtk/menu-items.c src/gtk/misc-gtk.c src/gtk/mkdir-dialog.c - Added
	description parameter to gftp_delete_cache_entry().

	* lib/protocols.c lib/gftp.h - added gftp_fd_open(). It will call 
	open() and then set the socket option close on exec

	* lib/cache.c lib/local.c lib/misc.c - use gftp_fd_open() instead of
	open()

	* lib/rfc959.c lib/protocols.c - on newly created sockets, make sure
	the close on exec socket option is set

	* lib/options.h src/text/gftp-text.c src/gtk/transfer.c - added
	preserve_permissions option

	* lib/protocols.c (gftp_parse_url) - allow an @ to be in the username

	* src/text/gftp-text.c - after transfering a file, honor 
	preserve_permissions if it is set

	* src/gtk/delete-dialog.c - improvments to clearing the expired cache
	entries

2003-6-14 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/cache.c (gftp_delete_cache_entry) - fix for restoring newlines

	* lib/gftp.h lib/protocols.c - added EOF flag for gftp_get_line()

	* lib/gftp.h lib/pty.c - added get_pty_impl() function for each PTY
	type

	* src/text/gftp-text.c - after removing files, clear the cache for
	that directory

2003-6-11 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/configure.in lib/gftp.h - portability fix for openpty(). (from 
	Nathan Robertson <nathanr@nathanr.net>, which he took from 
	http://mail.python.org/pipermail/patches/2000-June/000953.html)

	* lib/pty.h - found out about #elif preprocessor macro ;)

2003-6-9 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/bookmark.c lib/gftp.h lib/local.c lib/protocols.c lib/rfc2068.c
	lib/rfc959.c lib/sshv2.c - make return value of *_set_config_options()
	be an integer

	* lib/rfc2068.c lib/rfc959.c - return the error code of
	gftp_connect_server() if there was a connection problem

2003-6-8 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/rfc959.c lib/rfc2068.c - if gftp_connect_server() returns an
	error, make sure the exact error code is returned

2003-6-8 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/sslcommon.c - added entropy_len option. Added
	gftp_ssl_get_index(). Use SSL_get_ex_data() so that we can get the
	request structure, and error messages can be logged properly. Changed
	the verify depth from 4 to 9

2003-6-8 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/gftp.h lib/sslcommon.c - added ssl_register_module(). This
	function registers the configuration variables for the SSL engine.
	Right now, the only variable is the entropy source

	* lib/https.c (https_register_module) - call ssl_register_module().
	Multiple protocols will be able to call this function, it will only 
	be initialized once

2003-6-8 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/bookmark.c lib/gftp.h lib/https.c lib/local.c lib/misc.c 
	lib/protocols.c lib/rfc2068.c lib/rfc959.c lib/sshv2.c
	src/text/gftp-text.c src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c - made the init function for 
	all the protocols return an integer instead of nothing. If there was an
	error setting up the protocol, GFTP_EFATAL should be returned and the
	connection should be aborted. The HTTPS protocol uses this to return if
	SSL support was not compiled in

	* lib/protocols.c src/text/gftp-text.c src/gtk/dnd.c
	src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c src/gtk/menu-items.c - have gftp_parse_url() log the
	error messages to the user. This shouldn't have been done in the
	individual ports

	* lib/https.c - only initialize the SSL engine the first time a SSL
	connection is made.

2003-6-8 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* aclocal.m4 - removed, this file is automatically generated

	* autogen.sh - just call automake and aclocal, instead of automake-1.4
	and aclocal-1.4 (from Nathan Robertson <nathanr@nathanr.net>)

2003-6-8 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/https.c lib/options.h lib/sslcommon.c - make sure USE_SSL is
	defined before using any SSL functions

	* lib/gftp.h lib/protocols.c lib/rfc2068.c lib/sshv2.c lib/sslcommon.c
	lib/rfc959.c - make sure we use request->datafd for the connection. Removed
	sockfd from gftp_request structure

	* lib/rfc959.c - add data_connection to rfc959_parms structure. Use
	this for the FTP data connection

	* src/text/gftp-text.c - fixes for username/password prompt

	* src/gtk/misc-gtk.c src/gtk/transfer.c - s/sockfd/datafd/g

	* configure.in - added lib/Makefile (forgot to commit last time)

	* Makefile.am - added intl to SUBDIRS

2003-6-8 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/gftp.h - if USE_SSL is defined, include the OpenSSL headers.
	Added read_function, write_function and post_connect function pointers
	to gftp_request structure. Added SSL object to gftp_request structure
	if USE_SSL is defined. Added protocol number and init function
	declarations for the HTTPS protocol

	* lib/options.h - added HTTPS to the list of supported protocols

	* lib/protocols.c lib/cache.c lib/rfc2068.c lib/rfc959.c lib/sshv2.c -
	renamed gftp_read(), gftp_write() and gftp_set_sockblocking() to 
	gftp_fd_read(), gftp_fd_write() and gftp_fd_set_sockblocking()
	respectively

	* lib/bookmark.c lib/local.c 

	* lib/misc.c lib/rfc2068.c - moved base64_encode() to misc.c

	* lib/protocols.c - improved parsing of URLs. Rather than calling
	gftp_read() or gftp_write() directly, call the read_function or
	write_function that is set in the request structure. Expanded tabs 
	to spaces. Cleanup for parsing of timestamps. In
	gftp_connect_server(), if a post_connect function pointer is set,
	call it after we are connected to the server. Improvements to
	gftp_get_line (). 

	* lib/httpcommon.h lib/rfc2068.c - moved rfc2068_params structure to
	httpcommon.h. Fix for chunked file transfers, they were not handled 
	at all before. Made the I/O calls a little more generic so that we can
	read from either a socket or a SSL connection.

	* lib/sslcommon.c - added generic SSL layer

	* lib/https.c - added support for the HTTPS protocol. It piggy backs
	off of the existing HTTP support and uses the generic SSL layer

	* src/gtk/bookmarks.c src/gtk/chmod_dialog.c src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c
	src/gtk/menu-items.c src/gtk/misc-gtk.c src/gtk/options_dialog.c 
	src/gtk/view_dialog.c - set the window icon name to the gFTP <version>

	* configure.in - added lib back to SUBDIRS (oops)

	* lib/Makefile.am - added https.c, sslcommon.c and httpcommon.h

2003-5-27 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* Makefile.am configure.in autogen.sh - build fixes

	* src/text/gftp-text.c - if the protocol we are connecting to
	  doesn't need a username/password, don't prompt the user for one

2003-5-22 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/misc.c (gftp_usage) - updated usage statement

	* lib/options.h - put terminate options properly

2003-05-01  Hasbullah Bin Pit  <sebol@ikhlas.com>
                                                                                
        * configure.in(ALL_LINGUAS): Added "ms".

2003-4-27 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/config_file.c (gftp_config_file_read_float) - use strtod instead
	of strtof(). ANSI C describes strtod, and C99 describes strtof(). Some
	older systems don't have strtof() 

	* lib/gftp.h - if HAVE_OPENPTY is defined, include pty.h. Fix for
	GFTP_GET_AI_FAMILY when request or request->hostp is NULL. Added
	free_hostp boolean to struct gftp_request

	* lib/misc.c src/gtk/delete_dialog.c src/gtk/transfer.c - added 
	copy_local_options parameter. Add a pointer to newreq->hostp from the 
	source request structure

	* lib/protocols.c - honor free_hostp 

	* lib/rfc959.c - fix for IPV4/IPV6 detection

	* src/gtk/misc-gtk.c src/gtk/options_dialog.c - fixed compiler errors
	when compiling against GTK+ 1.2

	* src/gtk/transfer.c - lookup option one_transfer instead of 
	do_one_transfer_at_a_time

2003-04-27  Christian Rose  <menthos@menthos.com>

	* lib/rfc959.c: Fix bug #111090 by adding
	/* xgettext:no-c-format */ comment. This trivial bug prevented any
	full localization of gftp.

2003-4-25 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/rfc959.c - added IPV6 support (RFC2428). The only part of the
	project that isn't IPV6 ready is the proxy comparsion functions.

	* lib/protocols.c - change the hints.ai_family paramater from AF_INET
	to PF_UNSPEC

	* lib/gftp.h lib/misc.c lib/pty.c - moved the functionality of
	pty[ms]_open() to pty.c. Combined these 2 functions into open_ptys(),
	and there is one defined for each system type (lots of #define's in
	this file!)

	* lib/Makefile.am po/POTFILES.in - added pty.c 

	* lib/sshv2.c - when searching for the password prompt, omit the first
	character in case it is capitalized. Also, use the new function 
	open_ptys()

	* configure.in - search for openpty in -lutil. Also, define
	HAVE_OPENPTY if this function is present on the system


2003-4-23 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* Makefile.am - removed config.rpath from EXTRA_DIST

	used by the SSH protocol I ripped out

	* lib/config_file.c - fix for gftp_set_request_option(). Implemented 
	gftp_lookup_request_options(). Overriding of configuration options now 
	works across the board :)

	* lib/protocols.c - extra checks for freeing memory

	* src/text/gftp-text.c - renamed ssh_use_sftp_subsys to the proper
	name of sshv2_use_sftp_subsys

	to the proper name of append_transfers. Also, added quick fix for 
	start_file_transfers option that is still missing

	gftp_textcomboedt_widget_data

	* src/gtk/options_dialog.c - fixups for gftp_option_type_textcomboedt.
	The value will always convert %n to \n when reading in and then do the 
	opposite conversion when saving the variable. Also, added tooltips to 
	the options

	function. Renamed all instances of gftp_bookmarks to
	gftp_bookmarks_var

	and viewedit_processes_done. These used to be declared in
	lib/options.h

	g_static_mutex_*() functions from glib instead of pthread_mutex_*()

	* src/gtk/bookmark.c src/gtk/dnd.c src/gtk/menu-items.c
	src/gtk/transfer.c - use g_strdup() instead of g_malloc()/strcpy()

	* src/gtk/options_dialog.c - commented out large parts of this file.
	This file is busted at the moment

	* src/gtk/*.[ch] - Use new configuration interface in all source 
	files. Updated copyright dates on all source files

2003-4-8 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* src/text/gftp-text.c lib/misc.c - moved r_gethostbyname() and 
	r_getservbyname() to lib/misc.c. Now uses GMutex functions

	* lib/config_file.c lib/gftp.h lib/options.h - added config 
	variable type textcombo. default_protocol uses this

	* lib/config_file.c (gftp_read_config_file) - when reading in the
	list of supported protocols, add the protocol names to the list
	associated with default_protocol. Also, don't try to have
	default_protocol fall back to FTP. The code that uses this will fall
	back properly

	* lib/gftp.h (struct gftp_transfer) - renamed node to user_data

	* lib/misc.c lib/gftp.h - moved parse_attribs() from
	src/gtk/transfer.c to misc.c. Renamed to gftp_parse_attribs()

	src/gtk/transfer.c to protocols.c. Renamed to
	gftp_get_transfer_status(). Uses GMutex functions


2003-4-7 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* src/gtk/bookmarks.c - renamed struct gftp_bookmarks to
	gftp_bookmarks_var. In run_bookmark(), use gftp_parse_bookmark()

	src/gtk/transfer.c - use g_strdup() instead of g_malloc()/strcpy()

	* src/gtk/dnd.c src/gtk/menu-items.c - don't use depreciated macros 
	to access the request structure 

	* src/gtk/*.c - use new gftp_lookup_global_option() and
	gftp_lookup_request_option() functions

	* src/gtk/gftp-gtk.h src/gtk/gftp-gtk.c - moved viewedit_processes and
	viewedit_process_done variables from lib/gftp.h and lib/options.h

	* src/gtk/transfer.c - removed gftp_gtk_calc_kbs(). This is now in
	lib/protocols.c. Removed Binary/Ascii conversion. This is all done in
	lib/rfc959.c

2003-4-6 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/config_file.c src/text/gftp-text.c - changed arguments of 
	gftp_read_config_file() and gftp_read_bookmarks() to take an argument
	to the path of the global config directory. The text/gtk+ port will
	just pass SHARE_DIR. The native MacOS X port that is in the works
	needs this (Nathan Robertson is currently working on this port)

	* lib/gftp.h lib/config_file.c - removed config variable type
	gftp_option_type_textarray

	* lib/gftp.h lib/config_file.c - removed copy_function from

2003-4-5 Brian Masney <masneyb@gftp.org>
	* lib/config_file.c lib/options.h lib/gftp.h lib/rfc959.c
	lib/rfc2068.c lib/ssh.c - added new internal configuration interface. 
	Rather than having a global variable for each option, I have a global 
	hash table (gftp_global_options_htable) that I can look up option names
	by name using gftp_lookup_global_option(). I also an options hash 
	associated with a request structure, so I will be able to call 
	gftp_lookup_request_option(). I will be able to override options with 
	bookmarks or while transfers are in progress very easily now. Also, all
	options no longer have to appear in config_file.c, the per protocol 
	options can appear inside their own file

	* lib/gftp.h lib/bookmarks.c lib/local.c lib/rfc959.c lib/rfc2068.c -
	remove set_data_type and protocol name from struct gftp_request

	vars to GFTP_DIRTYPE_*

	* lib/gftp.h - removed ascii field and renamed the node pointer to 
	user_data in struct gftp_file. In gftp_request, removed any setting 
	that is now stored in the global/local hash tables. Added
	register_module() pointer that will be called whenever the protocol is
	first loaded into gftp

	* lib/rfc959.c src/text/gftp-text.c - moved the ascii/binary 
	translation to rfc959.c. Also, moved any instance of automatically 
	setting the data type to rfc959.c as well.

	* lib/misc.c lib/sshv2.c - moved all ssh functions from misc.c to
	sshv2.c. I had these origionally in misc.c because I used to have 2 
	different SSH protocols

	* lib/protocols.c src/text/gftp-text.c - added gftp_calc_kbs() to 
=	protocols.c. This no longer needs to be in the different ports

	* src/text/gftp-text.c - read/write options based on new configuration
	interface

	* Use new configuration interface in all source files

	* Updated copyright dates on all source files

	* Note: GTK+ port is completely broken at the moment. I'll upload
	those changes whenever I get them done
