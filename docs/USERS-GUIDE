1. Connecting to a remote site

This section describes the various ways that you can connect to a remote
site using gFTP.

1.1. Connecting using the Open URL button

   On the top line of gFTP you will see the word "Remote".  Click on Remote
and you will get a pop down menu.  Click on "Open URL" and you will get a
command line which has several uses.  You can enter a URL name in this
command line in a manner very similar to the way it works in most web
browsers.  You can type in the URL, paste the URL from the clipboard, or Drag
and Drop a URL from another application (say Mozilla).  gFTP will automatically
disconnect from the site that you are connected to, if any, and connect to the
site you specified in the Open URL window.

When you click on the Open URL button, several things are checked
(in the following order):

        - If you are already connected to a site and you click the Open URL
          button, you will be disconnected from the site that you are
          connected to.

        - If you have a hostname entered on the toolbar, it will connect to
          that host.

        - If the above 2 conditions are false, then it will bring up the
          Open URL dialog window where you can enter a FTP URL to connect to.
          FTP URL's can look like some of the following:

          ftp://ftp.myhostname.com/pub (this will log in as anonymous)
          ftp://user@ftp.myhostname.com/pub (log in as user. You will be
                                               prompted for a password)
          ftp://user:password@ftp.myhostname.com/pub (log in as user/password)

1.2. Connecting using bookmarks

   Bookmarks are the easiest way to connect to a remote site. Click on
Bookmarks and select which site you want to connect to from the pop down menu.
If gFTP doesn't have a password for the site you are trying to connect to, it
will prompt you for one.  Due to security reasons, gFTP will not save a password
in your bookmark file when gFTP obtains the password from a prompt.

1.3. Connecting using the toolbar

   You can use the toolbar at the top of the window to connect to a remote
site.  The only mandatory field to fill in is the hostname.  You can type in
the hostname or you can copy it from the clipboard.  When entering a hostname in
the toolbar do not include a directory name and file name.  If you do
enter a complete URL gFTP will eventually give you an error message:  "Cannot
look up hostname (hostname): Name or service not known".  If you have a complete
URL to enter or paste, a better method would be to go to section 1.1 and
use the Open URL button.  The way to handle a complete URL name on the toolbar
is to split up the URL with the hostname in the Host field and the directory
and/or file name in the directory name field on the right side of the screen
just above the message that says "Not connected*".

All of the other fields in the toolbar are optional:

   If you don't fill in the port, it will default to the ftp port in your
/etc/services file (usually port 21).

   If you don't fill in a username, it will default to logging you in as
anonymous.

   Once you have all your information filled in, you can either
hit enter in any of the host, port, user or password fields and gFTP will
connect you to the remote site.

1.4. Connecting using command line parameters

    You can start the GUI version of gFTP by using a KDE desktop application link
or a Gnome desktop application link.  If you want to go to a specific site
immediately on startup you can tell gFTP to connect to that site by typing in
that site's URL after the gftp command.  For example:
gftp  ftp://ftp.myhostname.com/pub

   gftp-gtk is a the name of the GUI version of gFTP.  The command gftp is
actually a script which decides whether, under the circumstances, to launch
gftp-text or gftp-gtk.  If gftp does not launch the version that you want you
can use gftp-text or gftp-gtk.


2. Downloading files

   Once you have successfully connected to a remote site you can then
select the files that you want and download them.  This section describes
several ways that you can select and download files in gFTP.

2.1. Traversing remote directory trees

   In the center of the right half of the gFTP screen you will find two windows.
The upper window shows what remote directory you are currently connected to.
The lower window is a listing of that directory's contents.  To open a
directory, double click on the directory name.  To go back up to a parent
directory double click on the .. at the top of the direcory listing.
Be careful that you are not double clicking on a file name unless you intend to
download that file.  You can also change directories by clicking on
Remote->Change Directory.

   You can control which files are shown in the remote directory window by
clicking on Remote->Change Filespec.  Then enter the filespec that you would
like to see.  For example you could enter *.rpm to eliminate everything but rpm
files in the directory listing.

   You can also control which files are shown in the remote directory window by
clicking on Remote->Show Selected.  Then the remote directory will only show
the file names of files that are also on the transfer queue.

   Almost every FTP site limits the portion of their directory tree that you
can access.  When you double click on the .. at the top of the directory
listing and nothing happens that means that you are as low in the directory
tree as you are allowed to go.

2.2. Downloading a Single File

   To download a file double click on the file name.
Or
   Drag and Drop a file name from the remote directory window to the local
   directory window.
Or
   Drag and Drop a file name from a web browser (such as Opera) to the
   gFTP local directory window.
Or
   Click on the file name and click on the left arrow near the center of the
   screen.

2.3. Downloading multiple files

   If you want to specify several files to download one after the other then you
must first throw the "Start file transfer" toggle off.  What this means is that
when the toggle is on, gFTP starts downloading immediately when you select a
file.  When the toggle is off you can stack up as many selections as you want
on the transfer queue without gFTP starting to download.  You can use any of the
selection methods described in the previous section on downloading single files.
You can also select several files at once by using some of the commands on the
Remote menu.  Click on Remote.  Click on the appropriate command(s) and then
click on left arrow.  The commands are:

    Select All Files - select every file in the current directory

    Select All - select every file in the current directory and every file in
                   every subdirectory of the current directory

    Deselect All - erase your selections and start over

   Then when you have finished selecting files you turn on the "Start file
transfer" toggle on and gFTP will begin working its way through all of the
downloads, one by one. To turn the toggle on click on
FTP->Options->Start file transfers->Apply->OK.

2.4. Downloading from multiple sites

    One of the features of gFTP is that you can queue download files from
different remote sites.  Once you have a file(s) download started, you can
safely disconnect from the remote site by clicking on Remote->Disconnect, and
it will not harm the download in progress.  You can then connect to another
remote site, and select another file(s) to download.  gFTP will add the new
selections to the transfer queue and download all of the files in the queue
sequentially.

2.5. Simultaneous downloads from multiple sites

   In the previous section I described how to queue up downloads from multiple
remote sites.  gFTP also has the ability to download from multiple sites
simultaneously.  Whether gFTP does the downloads sequentially or in parallel
is controlled by the "Do one transfer at a time" button.  To find this button:
click on FTP->Options.  When the "Do one transfer at a time" button
is on then gFTP will download files sequentially.  When the "Do one transfer at
a time" button is off then gFTP will open up a connection to each remote site
listed in the transfer queue and do as many downloads simultaneously as there
are remote sites in the transfer queue.

   Whether simultaneous downloading is an advantage to you or simply a confusion
factor depends on how you are connected to the Internet.  If you are connected
to an ISP with a dial-up modem then simultaneous downloading buys you nothing,
you should leave the "Do one transfer at a time" button on.  If you are on a
high speed local network connected to a proxy host which is attached to
multiple trunk lines then simultaneous downloads could save you a lot of
download time.  If you are not on a dial-up modem and haven't a clue about your
network line configuration I suggest that you turn off the "Do one transfer at a
time" button and give gFTP a real workout as a speed test.  If you get any
interesting results let me know.

2.6. Differences between downloading in ASCII and BINARY mode

   If you download a file in binary mode, gFTP will transfer the file as is,
making no modifications to it.  But, if you are downloading text files, you
should consider downloading them as ascii (unless you're downloading them from
another unix machine, in which case either ascii or binary works fine).  The
problem is that DOS and Unix use different methods to show end of line.

In DOS, the lines in text files will have a carriage return and line feed
after them:

This is a line in a DOS text file\r\n

But, in unix the file will just be stored with a line feed at the end:

This is a line in a UNIX text file\n

If you download a text file from a DOS machine as binary, and open it up in
an Unix program like vi, you will see some weird Ms at the end of each
line.  These are the carriage returns.  To get around this, download the file in
ascii mode, and gFTP will do the proper conversion for you.  You can change
between ascii and binary in the ftp menu.


3. Uploading files

   Uploading is a lot simpler if you collect all of the files that you want to
upload in the local directory before you connect to a remote site.  The local
directory is the directory you specified in FTP->Options->Startup Directory.

   Once you have successfully connected to a remote site you can then
select the files that you want and upload them to a specific place on the
remote site.  This section describes several ways that you can select and upload
files in gFTP.

3.1. Selecting the remote directory

   In the center of the right half of the gFTP screen you will find two windows.
The upper window shows what remote directory you are currently connected to.
The lower window is a listing of that directory's contents.  To open a
directory, double click on the directory name.  To go back up to a parent
directory double click on the .. at the top of the direcory listing.
Be careful that you are not double clicking on a file name unless you intend to
download that file.

      You can control which files are shown in the remote directory window by
clicking on Remote->Change Filespec.  Then enter the filespec that you would
like to see.  For example you could enter *.rpm to eliminate everything but rpm
files in the directory listing.

   You can also control which files are shown in the remote directory window by
clicking on Remote->Show Selected.  Then the remote directory will only show
the file names of files that are also on the transfer queue.

   Almost every FTP site limits the portion of their directory tree that you
can access.  When you double click on the .. at the top of the directory
listing and nothing happens that means that you are as low in the directory
tree as you are allowed to go.

3.2. Working with the remote file tree

   Uploading often consists of more than simply copying a file to a remote site.
You may have to create or rearrange portions of the file tree on the remote
site.  Right click on a blank spot in the directory window for the remote site
and you will get a pop up menu which contains some commands for manipulating the
remote site file tree.  These commands include:

   Delete - delete a remote file or directory

   Make Directory - create a directory on the remote site

   Rename - rename a remote file or directory

   Edit - edit a remote file using the editor specified in FTP->Options->Edit
            program

   View - view a remote file using the editor specified in FTP->Options->View
            program

   Chmod - change the attributes of a remote file or directory

3.3. Uploading a single file

   To upload a file double click on the file name in the local directory window.
Or
   Drag and Drop a file name from the local directory window to the remote
   directory window.
Or
   Click on the file name in the local directory and click on the right arrow
   near the center of the screen.
Or
   Drag and Drop a file name from a file manager such as Midnight Commander to
   the gFTP remote directory window.

3.4. Uploading multiple files

   If you want to specify several files to upload one after the other then you
must first throw the "Start file transfer" toggle off.  What this means is that
when the toggle is on, gFTP starts uploading immediately when you select a
file.  When the toggle is off you can stack up as many selections as you want
on the transfer queue without gFTP starting to upload.  You can use any of the
methods described in the previous section to select files to upload.  You can
also select several files at once by using some of the commands on the Local
menu. Click on Local. Click on the appropriate command and then click on right
arrow.  The commands are:

    Select All Files - select every file in the current directory

    Select All - select every file in the current directory and every file in
                   every subdirectory of the current directory

    Deselect All - erase your selections and start over

   Then when you have finished selecting files you turn the "Start file
transfer" toggle on and gFTP will begin working its way through all of the
uploads, one by one. To turn the toggle on click on FTP->Options->Start file
transfers->Apply->OK.

3.5. Passive and non passive file transfers

   When uploading files to a server you will find that some servers support
passive file transfers and others do not.  Those sites which do not support
passive file transfers usually block them because they consider passive file
transfers too insecure.  When you run into a site that does not support
passive file transfers you can try toggling passive file transfers off.  You can
find the passive file transfers toggle by clicking on File->Options.  Click on
the Passive file transfers button to toggle passive file transfers on and off.

   The most common error message given out by a site that does not support
passive transfers is:  Cannot create a data connection: Connection refused


4. Transferring files between remote sites (FXP)

   The File Transfer Protocol has a subsection called File eXchange Protocol.
gFTP can use FXP to transfer files between two remote sites.  gFTP will set up a
direct connection between the two remote sites so that the transfer proceeds
from one remote site to the other without your machine acting as an
intermediary.  In order for gFTP to do a FXP transfer both remote sites must
support FXP transfers.  Also the receiving site must support passive transfers
and the sending site must allow gFTP to open a port to the receiving site.  If
you cannot get the two remote sites to do a FXP transfer then the fall back
method is to download the file(s) from the source remote site to your machine
and then upload the file(s) to the receiving remote site.  The fall back method
will take at least twice as long as a FXP transfer and perhaps as much as an
order of magnitude longer.

   The next several sections describe the sequence of actions that you must
do in order to start a FXP transfer.  This explanation of FXP will assume that
you know how to use gFTP to download and upload files.  Check the sections on
downloads and uploads to fill in the details missing in the FXP explanation.

4.1. Connecting to the receiving site

   You connect to the receiving remote site the same as if you are doing an
upload to that site.

4.2. Selecting the receiving directory

   You select the receiving remote directory the same as if you are doing an
upload to that directory.

4.3. Working with the receiving file tree

   You manipulate the receiving remote file tree the same as if you are doing
an upload to that site.

4.4. Connecting to the sending site

   On the top line of gFTP you will see the word "Local".  Click on Local
and you will get a pop down menu.  Click on "Open URL" and you will get a
command line window.  You can enter an URL name in this command line in a manner
very similar to the way it works in most web browsers.  You can type in the
URL, paste the URL from the clipboard, or Drag and Drop an URL from another
application (say Konqueror).  gFTP will connect to the site you specify in the
Open URL window.

4.5. Traversing the sending site directory tree

   In the center of the left half of the gFTP screen you will find two windows.
The upper window shows what remote sending site directory you are currently
connected to.  The lower window is a listing of that directory's contents.  To
open a directory, double click on the directory name.  To go back up to a parent
directory double click on the .. at the top of the direcory listing.  Be
careful that you are not double clicking on a file name unless you intend to
transfer that file to the receiving remote site.  You can also change
directories by clicking on Local->Change Directory.

      You can control which files are shown in the left directory window by
clicking on Local->Change Filespec.  Then enter the filespec that you would
like to see.  For example you could enter *.deb to eliminate everything but
Debian files in the directory listing.

   You can also control which files are shown in the remote directory window by
clicking on Local->Show Selected.  Then the local directory will only show
the file names of files that are also on the transfer queue.

   Almost every FTP site limits the portion of their directory tree that you
can access.  When you double click on the .. at the top of the directory
listing and nothing happens that means that you are as low in the directory
tree as you are allowed to go.

4.6. Selecting files from the sending site

   If you want to specify several files to transfer one after the other then you
must first throw the "Start file transfer" toggle off by clicking on
FTP->Options->Start file transfers->Apply->OK.  If you are only transferring a
single file then you can ignore the "Start file transfer" toggle.

   To transfer a file double click on the file name in the left directory
   window.
Or
   Drag and Drop a file name from the left directory window to the right
   directory window.
Or
   Click on the file name in the left directory window and click on the right
   arrow near the center of the screen.

   Select as many files as you want from the left directory window and gFTP will
place them on the queue.  You can traverse the left directory window while you
are selecting files.  You can also select several files at once by using some
of the commands in the Local menu.  Click on Local.  Click on the appropriate
command and then click on right arrow.  The commands are:

    Select All Files - select every file in the current directory

    Select All - select every file in the current directory and every file in
                   every subdirectory of the current directory

    Deselect All - erase your selections and start over

   When you are finished selecting files then toggle "Start file transfer" on
and gFTP will start transferring the files in the queue.


5. Resuming transfers

   The File Transfer Protocol has the ability to restart an interrupted transfer
at the point where it left off.  gFTP supports the resume function.  If the
remote site you are dealing with also supports resume (most FTP sites do) then you can resume an interrupted transfer.

5.1. Manual resumes

   You can interrupt a transfer in the middle by exiting from gFTP and later
resume the transfer at the point where it left off.  To resume a download start
up the download just like any other download.  gFTP will find the partially
downloaded file in the local download directory and then ask you whether to
resume the download or to start all over.  Choose resume.  Then gFTP will
connect to the remote site and negotiate with the remote site to resume the
download at the point where it was interrupted.

   Uploads and FXP transfers can be resumed in a manner analogous to resuming a
download.

   The only sticking point with exiting gFTP and then starting it up again is
that you will lose the queue.  gFTP erases the queue when you exit and when you
start up again you will have to rebuild the queue.  If you are doing a single
file transfer then erasing the queue is unimportant.

   Resume is a well defined Internet protocol which requires the cooperation of
both gFTP and the server software.  Occasionally you will run into a server
which does not support the Resume protocol.  In the case of downloads all is
not necessarily lost.  gFTP will try to resume any download when it finds the
file name in the local download directory.  You might be able to salvage the
download by finding another remote site to download that same filename from, a
site that supports the FTP Resume protocol.

5.2. Automatic resumes

  If gFTP is in the process of transferring some files and the connection closes
for some reason, gFTP will try to reconnect again and continue with the file
transfer where it left off.  You can set how many times to reconnect and how
long to wait in the options dialog.  In order to specify reasonable reconnect
options you need to understand some of the things that can go wrong with a
transfer.

   The most common cause of transfer problems is an overloaded FTP server.  When
a server becomes overloaded there will be times when the server just can't get
around to passing gFTP the next block of data (or receiving the data in the
case of an upload).  In the gFTP progress window you will get a message that the
transfer is stalled.  If the transfer is stalled for over 30 seconds gFTP will
time out the transfer and disconnect. (Don't mess with the Read timeout Option
unless you know what you are doing. You can get timeouts for a lot of other
reasons that an overloaded server.) gFTP then waits the time interval specified
in FTP-Option and then reconnects.

   Some servers recognize when they are overloaded and begin deliberately
disconnecting clients until they get back down to the maximum number of
transfers that they can reasonably serve.  If gFTP gets disconnected it waits
the time interval specified in FTP->Options and then reconnects.  These servers
sometimes remember who they have just bounced off and if you try to reconnect
immediately they may tell gFTP to stop trying to automatically reconnect.  So in
the Options (Ftp->Options->Network->Retry sleep time) you want to wait just long
enough that the busy server will have forgotten you and then reconnect.  The
gFTP default is 15 seconds.

   The other reconnect Option that you are interested in is Connect retries
(Ftp->Options->Network->Connect retries).  Connect retries is the number of
times that gFTP will reconnect before giving up altogather.  There two ways to
approach this option:

   If gFTP has to keep reconnecting to a remote server then the transfer can be
very slow.  You might want to switch another remote server which is faster.
If the file name on the new server is exactly the same as the file name on the
previous server then you can resume a download at whatever point you got to on
the first server.  In this case set FTP->Options->Connect retries to 3, which is
the gFTP default.

   If you want to keep chugging away at the transfer until it finishes, no
matter what, then set FTP->Options->Connect retries to 0.


6. FTP password and user id

   The standard File Transfer Protocol requires the use of a user id and a
password.  gFTP will always use a user id and a password for each FTP
connection.

6.1. Anonymous FTP

   Many FTP server sites are public sites which make their files freely
available to anyone who wants to download them.  To get around the nuisance of
user ids and passwords public sites use the standard anonymous FTP protocol.
gFTP uses an user id of anonymous and a password that looks like a valid email
address (internet@linux.local).  You can change the anonymous email
address/password by clicking on FTP->Options->General and changing the Email
address field.

6.2. Secure FTP password and user id

   Some FTP server sites are private sites which are very selective about who
can download files from that site.  Almost all upload sites are selective.
Private sites insist that you obtain a user id and a password, perhaps even
pay money for them.  Then you have to use that particular user id and password
to access the private FTP site.

   If you want to save your password for a bookmarked site in the bookmark file,
you should read the section on security concerns first.  Then if you still
want gFTP to remember your bookmark entry passwords there are two ways to do it.
The easier way is to add the password manually to the bookmark file
(/home/user/.gftp/bookmarks) using a text editor.  Or you can have gFTP add
the bookmark password by: click on Edit bookmarks, right click on the
appropriate bookmark entry, click on Properties, and turn off "Log in as
ANONYMOUS".  Then gFTP will make the Username and Password fields available
for editing.

  You can tell gFTP not to use anonymous FTP by entering the user name in the
URL.  For example:

   ftp://user@ftp.myhostname.com/pub (log in as user. gFTP will prompt you
                                      for a password)

   You can give gFTP both the user name and password in the URL.  For example:

   ftp://user:password@ftp.myhostname.com/pub (log in as user/password)


6.3. FTP security concerns

   Some private FTP sites require you to use a valid email address as either the
user id or the password.  An organization with a reputable name to protect will
not spam your email address.  With other people or organizations you are
vunerable to spamming.  You might consider opening a free email account
somewhere and use it for spam bait only.


7. Local directory

   The local directory is the directory on your computer from which you will
upload files or which you will use to receive downloaded files.  A window
showing the local directory is located in the middle left of the gFTP screen.

7.1. Specifying the local directory

   You can set the default local directory by clicking on FTP->Options and then
   typing in the local directory path into Startup Directory.
Or
   You can change the local directory by entering the new name into the small
   window just above the local directory window.  Your new name will be entered
   into the local directory history but the new name will not replace the
   default name in Options.
Or
   You can select a name from the local directory history list.  Click on the
   down arrow to the right of the local directory name and then click on the
   history entry you want to use.  Your new name will be entered into the local
   directory history but the new name will not replace the
   default name in Options.
Or
   You can traverse the local directory tree by clicking on the directory names
   in the local directory window.  To open a directory, double click on the
   directory name.  To go back up to a parent directory double click on the ..
   at the top of the file listing.  Be careful that you are not double clicking
   on a file name unless you intend to upload that file.

7.2. Working in the local directory

   There are several operations that gFTP can perform in the local directory.
You can perform the following operations regardless of whether you are connected
to a remote site or not:

   Make a directory - Right click on a blank area in the local directory window.
      Then left click on Make Directory.  Enter the new directory name in the
      pop up window and click on Create.

   Delete a directory or filename - Right click on the directory or filename.
      Then left click on Delete.

   Rename a directory or filename - Right click on the directory or filename.
      Then left click on Rename.  Enter the new name in the pop up window and
      click on Rename.

   Change the attributes of a directory or filename - Right click on the
      directory or filename.  Then left click on Chmod.  Set the attributes in
      the pop up menu and click on Change.

   Edit a file - Right click on the filename.  Then left click on Edit.  The
      file will be opened in the editor that you specified FTP->Options->Edit
      program.

   View a file - Right click on the filename.  Then left click on View.  The
      file will be opened in the program that you specified FTP->Options->View
      program.

   Refresh the listing - Right click on a blank area in the local directory
      window.  Then left click on Refresh.  gFTP will refresh the local
      directory listing.

   Change the filespec - Click on Local->Change Filespec.  Then enter the
     filespec that you would like to see.  For example you could enter *.html to
     eliminate everything but html files in the directory listing.


7.3. Formating the local directory window

   You can arrange the format of the local directory window by sliding the
Filename, Size, User, Group, Date, and Attribs labels to wherever you want them.

   You can change the overall size of the local directory window by using a text
editor to change the config file (/home/user/.gftp/gftrc).  The parameters which
control the local directory window size are listbox_local_width and
listbox_file_height.


8. Remote directory

     The remote directory is the directory on a remote site from which you will
download files or which you will use to receive uploaded files.  A window
showing the remote directory is located in the middle right of the gFTP screen.

8.1. Specifying the remote directory

   When you enter a URL in the Remote->Open URL window, gFTP shows that portion
of the URL which designates a remote site directory name in the small window
just above the remote directory window.

8.2. Formating the remote directory window

   You can arrange the format of the remote directory window by sliding the
Filename, Size, User, Group, Date, and Attribs labels to wherever you want them.

   You can change the overall size of the remote directory window by using a
text editor to change the config file (/home/user/.gftp/gftrc).  The parameters
which control the remote directory window size are listbox_remote_width and
listbox_file_height.


9. Transfer window

   The transfer window is the second window from the bottom.  It shows the queue
and the progress of the current file transfer(s).

9.1. Queue

   The left hand side of the transfer window shows the queue of transfers to be
done.  You can stack several transfers in the queue and gFTP will work its way
through the queue transferring the files in the order that they were entered in
the queue.  Whether gFTP does the transfers sequentially or in parallel is
controlled by the "Do one transfer at a time" button.  To find this button:
click on FTP->Options.  When the "Do one transfer at a time" button is on then
gFTP will transfer files sequentially.  When the "Do one transfer at a time"
button is off then gFTP will open up a connection to each remote site listed
in the transfer queue and do as many transfers in parallel as there are remote
sites in the transfer queue.

   You can manipulate the entries on the transfers queue by first clicking on
the entry to highlight it and then clicking on Transfers.  The Transfers pop up
menu makes these commands available:

    Stop Transfer - highlight the queue entry for the file currently being
                      transferred and then click on Transfers->Stop Transfer

    Start Transfer - highlight the queue entry for the file you want to
                       transfer next and then click on Transfers->Start
                       Transfer

    Move File Up - move the file up one position in the queue

    Move File Down - move the file down one position in the queue

    Remove File - delete the file from the queue

    Skip Current File - leave the file name on the queue but do not transfer the
                          file

   gFTP does not save the transfer queue when gFTP exits.  If you exit gFTP and
then start it again you will have an empty queue.

9.2. Progress

   The right hand side of the transfer window shows the status of the
transfer(s) in progress.  gFTP shows the % completion of the entire queue, the
size of the file currently being transferred, how many bytes of the current file
have already been transferred, which files are finished transferring, and which
files are waiting to begin transferring.  The progress report also shows the
current transfer rate and gives an estimated length of time until the entire
queue is transferred.  Your milage may vary.

9.3. Formating the transfer window

   You can arrange the format of the transfer window by sliding the Filename and
Progress labels to wherever you want them.

   You can change the height of the remote directory window by using a text
editor to change the config file (/home/user/.gftp/gftrc).  The parameter
which controls the transfer window height is transfer_height.


10. Log and log window

   gFTP keeps a log (/home/user/.gftp/gftp.log) which records what gFTP has
done.  The log is erased and begun anew at each startup of gFTP.  The log
entries are displayed in the window at the bottom of the gFTP screen.  You can
specify a different location for your log file by clicking on FTP->Options and
entering the now location in Log file.

10.1. Log commands

   If you right click anywhere on the log window then a pop up menu will appear
with three commands:

   Clear - double clicking on Clear erases all of the log entries.

   View log - double clicking on View log launches the program you specified in
              FTP->Options->View program to display the log.

   Save log - double clicking on Save log opens a file tree display window which
              you can use to save the gFTP log anywhere that you want to put it.

   The Clear, View log, and Save log commands can also be accessed by clicking
on the Logging button at the top of the gFTP screen.

10.2. Formating the log window

   You can change the overall size of the log window by using a text editor to
change the config file (/home/user/.gftp/gftrc).  The parameters which control
the remote directory window size are log_height= and max_log_window_size=.

   You can change the colors of the various message types in the log window by
using a text editor to change the config file (/home/user/.gftp/gftrc).  The
parameters which control the log window message colors are
send_color=rrii:ggii:bbii, recv_color=rrii:ggii:bbii,
error_color=rrii:ggii:bbii, and misc_color=rrii:ggii:bbii.

   rrii:ggii:bbii is the color code where each letter stands for a hexidecimal
digit from o through f.

   rr - amount of red in the color
   gg - amount of green in the color
   bb - amount of blue in the color
   ii - intensity of the color

   examples:  bright red rrii:ggii:bbii = ffff:0000:0000
              dull brown rrii:ggii:bbii = a000:8d80:4600


11. Bookmarks

   gFTP has a bookmarks file which looks and acts very similar to the bookmarks
file in a web browser.  gFTP comes with several popular download sites listed in
the bookmarks file.

11.1. Using a bookmark entry

   To connect to a remote site, click on Bookmarks and a drop down menu appears.
Navigate the tree until you find the site you want to connect to.  Click on that
entry and gFTP will connect to that site.  If gFTP doesn't have a password for
the site you are trying to connect to, it will prompt you for one.  For
security reasons, gFTP will not save this password in your bookmark file when it
prompts you for it.

11.2. Adding a bookmark

   There are two ways to add a bookmark entry to the gFTP bookmark file:

   When you are connected to a site you can click on Bookmarks->Add bookmark.
gFTP will open a window in which you enter the entire path name for the new
entry.  For example:  If you find a Czech mirror site for SuSE downloads you
could file the bookmark as SuSE Sites/Czech mirror and gFTP will add Czech
mirror to the existing SuSE Sites folder.

   At any time, connected or not, you can add a bookmark entry by clicking on
Bookmarks->Edit bookmarks.  Then right click on a blank area of the bookmarks
window.  A menu will pop up.  Click on New item.  Then enter the entire path
name of the new entry in the pop up window.  (For example:  To create the first
site in a new Mandrake folder enter Mandrake Sites/USA mirror.)  Click on
create.  At this point you have created a bookmark entry that does not point
anywhere. Now right click on the new entry, click on Properties, and fill out
the information requested in the pop up form.  Click on Apply and click on OK.
You are now finished adding the new bookmark entry.

11.3. Editing bookmarks

   You can change the details in a bookmark entry by clicking on Bookmarks->Edit
bookmarks, right click on the bookmark entry, and click on Properties.  A form
will pop up which you can use to edit the entry.  Then click on Apply and OK.

   You can delete a bookmark or an entire folder of bookmarks by clicking on
Bookmarks->Edit bookmarks, right click on the bookmark entry, and click on
Delete.

   You can rearrange bookmarks with drag and drop.  Rearrangement of the
bookmark entries in gFTP works very similar to the way that it works in most web
browsers.  You drag the entry to the appropriate spot in the directory tree and
drop it.  With a little practice you can get the entries to go where you want
them to go.

11.4. Bookmark passwords

  If gFTP doesn't have a password for the bookmarked site you are trying to
connect to, gFPT will prompt you for one.  Due to security concerns, gFTP will
not save this password in your bookmark file.  If you want to save your
password for a bookmarked site in the bookmark file, you should read the section
on security concerns first.  Then if you still want gFTP to remember your
bookmark entry passwords there are two ways to do it.

   The easier way is to add the password manually to the bookmark file
   (/home/user/.gftp/bookmarks) using a text editor.  An example of a bookmark
   entry containing a password is:  ftp://user:password@ftp.myhostname.com/pub
Or
   You can have gFTP add the bookmark password by: click on Edit bookmarks,
   right click on the appropriate bookmark entry, click on Properties, and turn
   off "Log in as ANONYMOUS".  Then gFTP will make the Username and Password
   fields available for editing.  Enter the Username and Password fields.  Click
   on Apply and click on OK.

11.5. Bookmark security concerns

   When you save a password in the gFTP bookmark file you are creating a
potential security vulnerabilty because gFTP does not encrypt stored passwords.
Any cracker could write a program to extract passwords from the gFTP bookmarks
file.  You should weigh the chances of a malicious attack on your machine and
the value of the password protected data versus the convenience of storing the
passwords before deciding whether or not to store passwords in the bookmark
file.


12. FTP protocol

   File Transfer Protocol is a hardware and software independent Internet
protocol which is used to transfer information between servers and clients.
Servers are computers which give out information and clients are computers that
receive information.  It is possible for a computer to be both an FTP client and
server.  gFTP allows your computer to act as a FTP client.

   When gFTP contacts a FTP server it establishes two connections, a control
connection and a transfer connection.  gFTP first establishes a control
connection by sending an user id and a password to the server.  Then gFTP
requests that a particular file(s) be transferred.  Once gFTP has started a FTP
transfer gFTP can drop the control connection without interrupting the transfer.

12.1 Invoking FTP

   gFTP knows to use FTP by the first three letters of the URL.  An URL for a
   FTP transfer begins with ftp://.
Or
   Click on the button immediately to the left of the red light and click on FTP

14. SSH protocol

   SSH (Secure SHell) is a protocol which provides a high level of security
for transferring files from one computer to another across the Internet.  gFTP
implements the SSH protocol by calling upon an SSH program to wrap a layer of
security around what would otherwise be an ordinary FTP tansfer.  In effect
FTP "tunnels" through a secure SSH connection.

14.1. Configuring SSH

   In order to configure your SSH transfers click on FTP->Options->SSH and fill
out the form.  The required entries are:

    SSH Prog Name - This is the name of the program which provides the SSH
                      wrapper.
    SSH Extra Params - These are the parameters that the SSH wrapper program
                         needs to build an encryption key.

14.2. Invoking SSH

   gFTP knows to use SSH by the first three or four letters of the URL.  An URL
   for a SSH transfer begins with ssh:// or ssh2://.

15. Miscellaneous commands

15.1. Window

   You can reverse the roles of the local window and the remote window.  Click
on gFTP.  The Window 1 and Window 2 buttons can be used to switch the roles of
the local and remote windows.  Window 2 is the default and this user's guide
describes everything as set up by Window 2.  Clicking on Window 1 switches the
roles of the two windows to the mirror image of that described in this document.

15.2. SITE commands

   One of the features of the File Transfer Protocol is the ability to create
SITE commands.  A FTP server administrator can create customized commands for a
FTP client program, such as gFTP, to use.  These customized commands are called
SITE commands.

   If you want to use a SITE command while you are connected to a FTP server
then click on either Remote or Local, whichever is connected to the remote site
in question.  Then click on Send SITE Command and a pop up window will open.
You can enter the SITE command in the window.  Then click on OK and gFTP will
send the SITE command to the FTP server.

15.3. Bidirectional transfers

   It is possible that you may want to open a connection to a remote site and
transfer files in both directions.  Click on Transfers and you will find some
commands to help you change the direction of the transfers without having to
drop the connection and restart it in the other direction.  These commands are:

    Put Files - send the files on the transfer queue to the remote site

    Retrieve Files - copy the files on the transfer queue from the remote site
                       to the local site

15.4. Clear cache

   gFTP keeps a cache of data from remote sites.  It is possible that while you
are working with a remote site other people are making changes to that site.  To
get rid of stale copies of the remote directory tree in the cache click on
Tools->Clear Cache.

15.5. Compare Windows

   An easy way to check which files have been transferred and which files have
not is to click on Tools->Compare Windows.  gFTP will highlight any file names
which appear in either the local directory or the remote directory but not both.

15.6. Disconnect

   You can disconnect from a remote site at any time.  Disconnecting does not
stop any transfers already in prograss.  You can disconnect by:

  clicking on the red button when it is lit up
Or
  clicking on Remote->Disconnect
Or
  clicking on Local->Disconnect


16. Using gftp-text (the command line version of gftp)

   The gFTP package includes a completely functional command line version of
gFTP.  You can launch the command line version by typing in the command,
gftp-text, at your console prompt.  The command gftp is actually a script which
decides whether, under the circumstances, to launch gftp-text or gftp-gtk.  If
gftp does not start the version that you want you can finesse that problem by
using gftp-text or gftp-gtk instead of gftp.

16.1. Downloading entire directories and subdirectories

   If you want to download entire directories including subdirectories you
should look at using gftp-text.  Some downloads are simpler to invoke using
gftp-text.  For example:

   gftp-text -d ftp://ftp.somesite.com/someplace

   If someplace is a directory, it'll automatically download all its
subdirectories as well. If you want to transfer a file through SSH instead of
FTP then change the ftp:// to ssh://

16.2. Documentation for gftp-text

   gftp-text will give you a prompt: ftp>
You can learn more about gftp-text by typing in help at the ftp> prompt.  You
can also get instructions in how to use gftp-text by typing in "man gftp" or
"info gftp" at the console prompt.


17. Using gftp-gtk

   gftp-gtk is the name of the GUI version of gFTP.  The gftp command is
actually a script which decides whether, under the circumstances, to launch
gftp-text or gftp-gtk.


18. Configuring gFTP

   All of the gFTP configuration options are specified in the file
/home/user/.gftp/gftprc.

18.1. Proxy host setup

   If your computer is on a local network then you are probably connected to the
internet through a proxy host.  A proxy host can connect several users to the
internet.  A proxy host often also acts as a firewall, possibly filtering
messages in both directions.  If you are connected to the internet through a
proxy host then gFTP needs passwords and other configuration information to
make a connection through the proxy host to the internet.

   To set up your proxy host and/or firewall configuration, click on
FTP->Options.  You can click on FTP Proxy to set up your
proxy hosts, user names, and passwords.  In the FTP Proxy form, you can set up
how you want gFTP to log into the proxy host.  I have many of the common types
of proxy hosts that you will encounter already descried in gFTP.  If you are
using a very complex proxy host configuration then you may have to use a text
editor to edit the config file (/home/user/.gftp/gftprc).  The fields in the
config file that pertain to proxy host and/or firewall configuration are:

    # Firewall hostname
    firewall_host=

    # Port to connect to on the firewall
    firewall_port=21

    # Your firewall username
    firewall_username=

    # Your firewall password
    firewall_password=

    # Your firewall account (optional)
    firewall_account=

    # This specifies how your proxy server expects us to log in
    proxy_config=

18.2. Proxy security concerns

   When you have gFTP save a proxy password you are creating a potential
security vulnerabilty.  gFTP does not encrypt stored passwords.  They are kept
in plain text in the file, /home/user/.gftp/gftprc.  Any cracker could write
a program to extract passwords from the gftprc file.  You should weigh the
chances of a malicious attack on your machine and the value of the proxy
passwords versus the convenience of storing the passwords before deciding
whether or not have gFTP store proxy passwords.  Also if you are on a local
network then you are probably a member of a beaurocracy, lucky you.  In that
case you should give a passing thought to your organization's security rules.

18.3. Configuring file extensions

   gFTP has the ability to use mime types.  Some mime types come pre-configured
with gFTP and you have complete control to configure the gFTP mime types any way
that you want.

   Towards the bottom of the config file (/home/user/.gftp/gftprc), there is a
section that has some ext= lines.  Here you can control via a file extension,
the icon in the listbox for it, the default transfer method (ascii or binary),
and a default view/edit program.  For example, let's take the line:

ext=.xcf:gimp.png:B:gimp

The first token, .xcf, is the file extension.  The next token, gimp.png, is
the default icon to use in the listboxes.  You don't have to specify one if
you don't want to.  By default, gFTP will search ~/.gftp, $(PREFIX)/share/gftp
(where prefix is your installation prefix), and then /usr/share/icons in that
order.  The files must be valid png or xpm files.  The next token, B, specifies
whether or not to transfer a file as Binary or Ascii.  If you want to have
something transfer as Ascii, put an A there.  If you omit this field, then gFTP
will transfer the file according to whether ascii or binary is selected in
the gFTP menu.  The final token, gimp, specifies the name of the program to run
to view or edit a file with that extension.  You can omit this as well if you
like.

18.4. Desktop icon

   You can set up gFTP to be started from your Gnome or KDE desktop.  The
program name can be either gftp or gftp-gtk.  Some suitable gFTP icons are
available in /usr/share/gftp: world.png
